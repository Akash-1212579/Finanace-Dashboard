step 1 :- 
adding existing catgories to category table example

id | name           | type     | userId
---+----------------+----------+-------
1  | Food           | EXPENSE  | 10
2  | Healthcare     | EXPENSE  | 10
3  | Entertainment  | EXPENSE  | 10
4  | Salary         | INCOME   | 10

main issue is with  storing it with userId for this i can store userId 
when user uploads csv from auth will get userId.

so now 
user will upload csv    
        |
        | 
        ↓
after upload i will get userId,csvFile in req body        
        |(controller part)
        | 
        ↓
after getting csv file first parsing it into a csv strings and converting
it in to a json and normalizing json and store(didnt storing json directly) 
but initially we have stored categoryId column data as null
but now i want to categorize using llm 


LLM PART :-

giving llm data in objects of transactions like (descriptions means merchant name mostly)

this is means transactionid(after uploading we will get that id)
[
  { "id": 101, "description": "Zomato order" },
  { "id": 102, "description": "Apollo pharmacy" }
]

then LLM give output as
[
  { "transactionId": 101, "category": "Food" },
  { "transactionId": 102, "category": "Healthcare" }
]
now from category table getting categoryId  where categoryName && userId
and setting that categoryId to a categoryId(in transaction table)
eg
UPDATE Transaction
SET categoryId = 1
WHERE id = 101; 


sample output tested with postman
 {
    "1": "Shopping",
    "2": "Transport",
    "3": "Utilities",
    "4": "Entertainment",
    "5": "Healthcare",
}

this is what llmservice will return
[
  { transactionId: 1, category: 'Shopping' },
  { transactionId: 2, category: 'Transport' },
  { transactionId: 3, category: 'Utilities' },
  { transactionId: 4, category: 'Entertainment' },
  { transactionId: 5, category: 'Healthcare' }
]
